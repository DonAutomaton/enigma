## Description
This is the backend for the Enigma project. At the moment it is a simple C prject that can be compiled with gcc. 
First steps are to create a CLI interface for the program, later a REST API will be added.

## Usage

### Compilation
To compile the program, simply run `make` in the root directory. This will create a binary called `enigma` in the `bin` directory.
